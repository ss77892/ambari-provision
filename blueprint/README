## Expectations:

* Ambari server is installed on the first node.
* 3-Node HBase configuration provided.
* Hostnames in the cluster.json file need to be updated.

## Usage:

`./provision-gateway.sh ~/.ssh/my_key <ambari-server>`
`./provision-nodes.sh ~/.ssh/my_key <ambari-server> <node> <node> ...`

## New cluster creation:

1. Install an Ambari cluster to your liking
2. Run `curl -H "X-Requested-By: ambari" -X GET -u admin:admin "http://YOUR_AMBARI_SERVER:8080/api/v1/clusters/YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME?format=blueprint" > blueprint.json
3. Build your own cluster.json file based on one of the examples in the other. Make sure the host_groups in your blueprint.json match what you define in the cluster.json

## TODO:

* Create HDFS dir for test user
* Make sure test user can password-less SSH (authorized_keys)
* Disable requiretty for test user in /etc/sudoers
* install yum-utils
